# challenge0001-submissions
CSS art :0

## Description

For our very first challenge, we want you to create art **using only CSS**. While you can use a scripting language to auto-generate CSS, no language other than CSS can be used to render your masterpiece. You are allowed to use CSS frameworks like [sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

Here are some resources to get you started:
- https://dev.to/poulamic/intro-to-creating-css-art-1ep5
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
- [Sample submission](sample-css-dog)

**Do not submit source code from an existing CSS art piece. You will be disqualified.**

The winner will be determined by the HexLabs team. We will record a short-video showcasing the top 5 submissions.
